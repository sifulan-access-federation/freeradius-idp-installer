		# THIS IS SITE SPECIFIC
		#
		# The files module is *ONLY* used for testing.  It lets you define 
		# credentials in a flat file, IT WILL NOT SCALE.
		#
		# - If you use OpenLDAP with salted password hashes you should 
 		#   call the 'ldap' module here and use EAP-TTLS-PAP as your EAP method.
		# - If you use OpenLDAP with cleartext passwords you should 
		#   call the 'ldap' module here and use EAP-TTLS or PEAPv0.
		# - If you use an SQL DB with salted password hashes you should call 
		#   the 'sql' module here and use EAP-TTLS-PAP as your EAP method.
		# - If you use an SQL DB with cleartext passwords you should call 
		#   the 'sql' module here and use EAP-TTLS or PEAPv0.
		# - If you use Novell you should call the 'ldap' module here and 
		#   set ``edir = yes`` in ``mods-available/ldap`` and use EAP-TTLS or
		#   PEAPv0.
		# - If you use Active Directory, you don't need anything here (remove 
		#   the call to files) but you'll need to follow this 
		#   [guide](freeradius-active-directory-integration-howto) and use 
		#   EAP-TTLS-PAP or PEAPv0.
		# - If you're using EAP-TLS (i'm impressed!) remove the call to files.
		#
		# EAP-TTLS-PAP and PEAPv0 are equally secure/insecure depending on how the 
		# supplicant is configured. PEAPv0 has a slight edge in that you need to 
		# crack MSCHAPv2 to get the user's password (but this is not hard).
